# AIDemoUI
 Simple Wpf UI for an AI Demo App (both unfinished/in progress)

Goals:
- (visual) help in learning how to build and train a neural network
- easy net building 'on click', without any need to write code
- easy creation/import of sample data via file path, url or by some given presets (e.g. MNIST)
- observe neuron & weight changes visually, incl step by step mode
